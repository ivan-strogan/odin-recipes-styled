        to at least 13th-century France.

      <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in
          milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat
          until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour
          or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
          each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter
          coats the surface evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has
          turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of
          the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side
          has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
