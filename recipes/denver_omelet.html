      <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
      <p>
        The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known
        for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first
        foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school.
        Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.

      <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>

        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>

      <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and
          bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions
          soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula
          while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.
          Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese
          and cayenne pepper over omelet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not
          runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and
          transfer it to a plate.
